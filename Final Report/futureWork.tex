\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futureWork}
 We have spent most of our time dealing with the configuration of the AWS, and dealing with several issues with
the Pig and Hive script. Therefore, in our project there is room for improvement. One of the biggest enhancement of this paper will be the visualization part. Due to the reason above mentioned, we didnâ€™t have time to create a customized visualization for the analysis of the climate dataset. Our current visualization is good enough for 1 or 2 years. However, when we need to visualize more years, all the data became obscure due to the large amount of results.
