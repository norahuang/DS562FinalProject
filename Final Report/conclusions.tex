\section{Conclusions}
To summarize, Amazon Web Services is a very efficient tool for the analysis of large datasets. By using AWS we were able to built a sophisticated and scalable application for the climate dataset that we have. We begin with the problem of how to analyze a big data in the climate field, and how to make some computations for getting the desired result, in this case having the average of the climate change of certain locations.

By using AWS we can experience how big data can be processed and managed, in order to have meaningful results. At the end of this project we can understand why many people and companies use AWS, due to it is very efficient and fast tool. After we understood how to configured ï¿¼ it and use the pig and hive process. We realized how simple and efficient is to use this infrastructure. The AWS takes care of the complex task of coding and manage the MapReduce algorithm, and we just need to focus on developing the Pig and Hive scripts.

At the end of this project, we were very satisfied about the results that we got. We were able to take a large data set and use a current and popular tool for solving our analysis needs. After devoting some time to understand this new technology for us, we are very satisfied about how a tool as the AWS can be used. Besides, we are confident that in the future we will be able to use similar technologies.
